/// constraints and solving a linear problem each time (using a custom sparse solver)
/// It is significantly slower than iterative methods, but it gives an almost exact solution
/// (within numerical roundoff and accumulation errors, of course). It can handle redundant constraints.
/// This solver must be used for mixed-linear complementarity problems (MLCP) in this form:
///
///    | M -Cq'|*|q|- | f|= |0| ,   c>=0, l>=0, l*c=0;
///    | Cq  0 | |l|  |-b|  |c|
///
///   as arising in the solution of QP with
///   inequalities or in multibody problems.
